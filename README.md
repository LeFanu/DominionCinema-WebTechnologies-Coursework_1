This is the replica of the booking system for Dominion Cinema. It was created from scratch using jQuery and relying on one jSON file, which provided or the data needed to create the page.
This was the first Coursework for Web Technologies module on my 2nd year at Edinburgh Napier University. The point of this coursework was to learn how to use jSON and jQuery and we weren't allowed to change HTML. We could use CSS.
Later addition was the database connection and real time changes making it more realistic.
